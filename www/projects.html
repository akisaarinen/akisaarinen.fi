          for which it was originally written for, but not developed any more.
          Based and developed mostly as part of my Master's Thesis. The first
          real project I used Scala for.

          <a href="https://github.com/akisaarinen/lullizio">Lullizio</a>, a
          simple IRC bot written in Ruby. Shouts all kinds of useful and
          non-useful stuff to IRC channels, like Youtube video titles and

        <li>
          <a href="http://akisaarinen.fi/netogler/">NetOgler</a>, a distributed
          data gathering platform. Developed with C++ using the <a

          summer project with <a href="http://www.aropupu.fi/">Teijo Laine</a>
          in 2008. Nice experiment combining Qt, networks and graph
          visualization, but not developed any further.

          back-end for multiplayer support, which is kind of cool. Haven't
          touched this since 2005. Please don't judge my present coding
          skills based on this :-)
