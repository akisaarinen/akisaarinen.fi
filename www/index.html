&gt; Hello,
&gt;
&gt; I was left wondering whether xkcd http://xkcd.com/302/ (Names), is
&gt; referencing the popular TV show Friends by using the name Rachel in the
&gt; altar (as you might know, Ross failed at the altar by saying Rachel instead
&gt; of Emily in the Friends season 4 episode 24).
&gt;
&gt; I'm a fan of the Friends, so I can't help but think that this is yet another
&gt; ingenious reference in the xkcd series. But it might just be a coincidence,
&gt; too... I can't rest until I know the truth, so if you have the time to
&gt; answer this, I'd be really pleased!  :)
&gt;
&gt; Sincerely,
&gt; Aki Saarinen

You can rest -- sadly, it's not a reference.  I am pretty unfamiliar
with Friends.  I think I've seen about one episode, total.  It's a big
gap in my pop-culture knowledge.  It's just based on my own
embarrassing experience (suitably exaggerated)  :)

Best,

Randall

      I was of course a little bit disappointed that it was not referencing
      Friends but really big thanks to Randall for replying! Finally, I
      can rest.

        <b>January 2008</b>: As a fashion aware(yea, right) nerd I decided to put up a blog. It's written in Finnish
        so all of you may not need to bother. You can visit it in <a
            href="blog/">http://akisaarinen.fi/blog/</a>, but be warned: so far there's
        not really any content. Because the language I'm most comfortable with is
        Finnish, it's probably the language I want to express myself when in urgent
        need to tell the world about something. 
        <br/><br/>
        <b>Update in December 2008</b>: seems like the blog is still empty, even though quite
        a lot has happened since I started it... Hmm... Maybe this concept
        needs some re-thinking. :)
