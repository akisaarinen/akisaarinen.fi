Yesterday I wanted to add a new post to the social bookmarking service,
[trunk.ly](http://trunk.ly), by emailing a link to my
username+magicnumber@post.trunk.ly address.  I was typing the address out of my
memory and unfortunately sent my link to @trunk.ly instead of the correct
address at @post.trunk.ly. 

In many services a mistake like this could result in a silent failure and a
lost email. Or some technical “Deliveration failed: error 0xF3F3”. Afterall, I
did email to a stupid address, right?

Trunk.ly did something different. I received a personalized reply, with
trunk.ly co-founder Tim Bull as the sender:

    From: Tim Bull <tim@trunk.ly>
    To: Aki Saarinen <..>
    Subject: Re: LiveReload
    
    Hi Aki,
    
    Just FYI - the links need to mailed to post.trunk.ly NOT trunk.ly :-)
    
    Cheers,
    Tim Bull

How amazing is that! It made me feel that they really want to take good care of
me and my links. In a technical sense things like this are not hard to
implement, it's just that we often don't even think about it.
