I wrote an article about C++ development with Qt, together with my colleagues
Sami Rosendahl and Tuomas JÃ¤rvensivu at Reaktor. Check it out at [Reaktor's
site](http://reaktor.fi/en/our_expertise/qt/).

It's interesting to see what happens to Qt in the future. It's clearly one of
the best C++ libraries I've used and I'm sincerely hoping they'll stay on the
right path.
