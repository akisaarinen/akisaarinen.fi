The new design of Google Reader has been
[debated](http://fury.com/2011/11/my-offer-to-google-reader/) [a
lot](http://www.betabeat.com/2011/11/02/sharebros-everybody-hates-the-new-google-reader/).
I was also frustrated by unnecessary large margins and useless bars, especially
when reading from my 13" laptop screen.

I made a simple Chrome extension to fix things up a little. You can install
[CleanReader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/eigifncndbofnhijdnkfcgooiolblpbl)
from the Chrome Web Store for free. Sources are available at
[GitHub](https://github.com/akisaarinen/cleanreader).
